Pear OS Monterey : Has plasma desktop: mac os exp.. based of ubuntu -- Mac copy
Cutefix OS: Built of Manjaro... chinese? Don't download!!!!!!!!!
Rlx OS: Built from scratch... Uses Gnome.. Immutable system -- Very new.. Very fast.. but sound failed in kvm
ArchCraft: based on arch: Very less minimal ram... No desktop.. Just window manager -- Not suitable for daily work
Pop OS Cosmic: based on Ubuntu.. Simple design -- Already tried.. Very simple UI
Solus 4.3: Independent like rlx..Looks simple -- Yet to mature. KDE desktop windows are transparent
manjaro: Let me see whether it works in KVM
